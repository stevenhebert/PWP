your page isn't working at all for me on my phone. This looks like it's an issue with onePageScroll on Chrome for Android. I would disable this functionality entirely on mobile, and only enable it on larger screen sizes. This can be done by adding some simple jQuery that only fires the onePageScroll() function on screens greater than a certain width.

There are also some problems with your contact form:
jQuery validation and AJAX handling is not working at all. the form isn't passing through the front-end validation at all.

form output area redirects to new page
