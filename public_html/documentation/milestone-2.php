		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Header: My websites header will contain anchors directing viewers to different content locations on the
				page. My preliminary idea for
				content-sections include, "Home", "Code", "Contact", and "Resume".
			</li>
			<li>Main: This will be the main-landing for those who visit my page. I will provide a brief description of the
				websites content and myself; perhaps a
				sentence providing context for the content that follows, and some words or a quote that I might use to
				describe myself.
			</li>
			<li>Code: This section will present my greatest coding-accomplishments and current coding-projects. It MIGHT
				even be formatted as a visual-resume of sort where I can map where I've been, where I am, and where I'm
				thinking about going (in terms of code). Depending the type of project I will include a link to its
				repository or a live-link to the project itself.
			</li>
			<li>Contact: This will bring the website patron to a section where they can contact me. Initial thoughts for
				modes of contact include: email, work phone, and/or slackId. Additionally, there will be a form where the
				user
				can send me a text-only-email-message/inquiry directly from the site.
			</li>
			<li>Resume: Here an integrated? (not downloadable) resume would be presented. This, in addition to my coding
				experience would list my other professional credentials.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Goals</h1>
		<p>Establish a professional web presence, acquire internships or part-time work, and summarize my past and current
			projects.</p>


		<h1>Persona</h1>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name </strong>Gene Blue</li>

			<li><strong>Description </strong>Gene is the chief technology officer at XYZ, a tech startup. XYZ is searching
				for a junior
				developer to help with backend operations. Gene, a senior developer, comes to XYZ from established firm. His
				expertise is
				needed to establish a minimal problem engineering team that can effectively produce and revise mobile
				applications.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Goals </strong>Gene is seeking an employee that understands his/her role in XYZ. Gene's employee
				will be joining
				one or two frontend developers, his ideal applicant possesses knowledge of both spectrum. Under a lot of
				pressure already,
				Gene has little time to parse resumes and headhunt, he's looking for a concise summary of a potential
				employees experience
				and interests.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Technology </strong>XYZ maintains an up-to-date toolbox of phones, tablets, and computers used to
				test their software.
				iOS and Android devices are most common following with macOS and Windows10, occasionally Gene may test with
				a linux or
				windows mobile device. XYZ employs Google Fiber for their broadband connection and Verizon for their mobile
				connection.
			</li>

			<li><strong>Additional Information </strong></li>

		</ul>

		<h1>Use Case</h1>
		<p>It has been a week since Gene posted XYZ's employment opportunity. His inbox has blown up with a vareity of
			individuals interested
			in the position. Gene downloads the attachments and eliminates those missing certain keywords. Next he searches
			the remaining resumes
			for familiar references and project names.</p>

		<p>He strips the contact information from the remaining resumes and imports them to a contact list. Gene then
			bcc's the list a request
			for a project with experience relevant to the position or a portfolio of the applicants past work. After a
			couple days Gene will pick
			ten finalists for an interview and offer one of them the position. </p>
