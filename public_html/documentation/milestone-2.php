		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

		<ul>

			<li>Header: My websites header will contain anchors directing viewers to different content locations on the
				page. My preliminary idea for
				content-sections include, "Home", "Code", "Contact", and "Resume".
			</li>
			<li>Main: This will be the main-landing for those who visit my page. I will provide a brief description of the
				websites content and myself; perhaps a
				sentence providing context for the content that follows, and some words or a quote that I might use to
				describe myself.
			</li>
			<li>Code: This section will present my greatest coding-accomplishments and current coding-projects. It MIGHT
				even be formatted as a visual-resume of sort where I can map where I've been, where I am, and where I'm
				thinking about going (in terms of code). Depending the type of project I will include a link to its
				repository or a live-link to the project itself.
			</li>
			<li>Contact: This will bring the website patron to a section where they can contact me. Initial thoughts for
				modes of contact include: email, work phone, and/or slackId. Additionally, there will be a form where the
				user
				can send me a text-only-email-message/inquiry directly from the site.
			</li>
			<li>Resume: Here an integrated? (not downloadable) resume would be presented. This, in addition to my coding
				experience would list my other professional credentials.
				<li>A nice solid color footing contrasted to the pages background such that it that gently interrupts the
				users downward scroll, visually informing them that although their viewing is welcomed, the presentation of
				additional content is no more. To lessen this blow, a mini-sitemap might also make an appearance anchoring
				the user to the main-landing and the contact section.
			</li>

		</ul>
