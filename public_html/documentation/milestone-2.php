		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

		<ul>

			<li>Header: My website header will contain anchors directing viewers to different content locations on the
				page. My preliminary ideas for content-sections include, "Home", "Code", "Contact", and "Resume".
			</li>
			<li>Main: This will be the main-landing for my website visitors. I will provide a brief description of the
				pages content and myself; perhaps a sentence providing context for the content that follows, and some words
				or a quote that I might use to describe myself.
			</li>
			<li>Code: This section will present my greatest coding-accomplishments and current coding-projects. It MIGHT
				even be formatted as a visual-resume of sort where I can map where I've been, where I am, and where I'm
				thinking about going (in a code skill sense). Depending on the type of project, I would include either a
				link to its repository or a live-link to the project itself.
			</li>
			<li>Contact: Here my websites patron will be presented several acceptable ways to communicate with me. Initial
				thoughts for acceptable modes of contact include: email, work phone, and/or slackId. Additionally, there
				will be a form where the user can send me a text-only-email-message/inquiry directly from the site.
			</li>
			<li>Resume: Here an integrated? (non-downloadable) resume would be presented. This, in addition to my coding
				experience would list my other professional experience, skills, and credentials.
			<li>A nice solid color footing contrasted against the pages background such that it that gently interrupts
				the users downward scroll, visually informing them that although their viewing is welcomed, the presentation
				of
				additional content is no more. To lessen this blow, a "top" anchor makes an appearance anchoring the user
				back to the pages main-landing.
			</li>

		</ul>
