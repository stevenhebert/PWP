		<h1>Persona</h1>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Name </strong>Gene Blue</li>
			<li><strong>Description </strong>Gene is the chief technology officer at XYZ, a tech startup. XYZ is searching for a junior
				developer to help with backend operations. Gene, a senior developer, comes to XYZ from established firm. His expertise is
				needed to establish a minimal problem engineering team that can effectively produce and revise mobile applications.</li>
			<li><strong>Goals </strong>Gene is seeking an employee that understands his/her role in XYZ. Gene's employee will be joining
				one or two other backend developers so he needs someone with proven experience. Under a lot of pressure already, Gene
				has little time to parse resumes and headhunt, he's looking for a concise summary of a potential employees experience and
				interests.</li>
			<li><strong>Technology </strong>XYZ maintains an up-to-date toolbox of phones, tablets, and computers used to test their software.
				iOS and Android devices are most common following with macOS and Windows10, occasionally Gene may test with a linux or
				windows mobile device. XYZ employs Google Fiber for their broadband connection and Verizon for their mobile connection.</li>
			<li><strong>Frustrations </strong>His previous experience with both front end and back end has lead him to his current
				position. Often frustrated by then lack of coordination between these divisions, he's looking to hire developers
				that also understand this barrier. He feels this is especially important for startups, where synergy is vital
				to their survival.</li>
